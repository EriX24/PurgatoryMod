# Purgatory

Adds a unique way to respawn when you die in Minecraft!

****

**Dying** 

When you die you will now drop a player head, as well as being put in spectator mode.

**Respawning**

When you right-click the players head with a golden apple, the apple will be used to revive the player

**Inventory Unrecoverable**

If you can't get the player's head to revive them, you can simply right-click a skeletons
head with a paper that is renamed to their username to convert the skull to their head.

**Purpose**

This mod is supposed to be used in multiplayer! If you are on single player this is the equivalent of hardcore mode.
This is supposed to be more lenient multiplayer hardcore mode.

**Plans**

 - Add feature for changing weather or not this mod has effect in a world.
 - Add a way to self-revive if all players are dead.
 - Add a config file for whether a player drops their head.
 - Add a config file for whether a player's head can be created with paper and a skull.
 - Add a config file for whether self-revive is enabled.

**Changelog**

 - 1.0.1: Patched dimensional warps

**Bugs**

 - Dimensional warps: when you die or get revived in the nether or end (end is only bugged for revival), you will revive in the overworld [PATCHED IN 1.0.1]
